# Adaptive-Power-Thermal-Management-for-Embedded-SoCs-using-Reinforcement-Learning
Modern embedded systems, ranging from IoT devices to smartphones, face a critical
design challenge: balancing computational performance with power consumption to extend
battery life and maintain thermal stability. Traditional power management strategies often rely
on static policies (&quot;Performance&quot; or &quot;Power Save&quot;) or simple, rule-based heuristics (reactive
governors), which are frequently suboptimal for dynamic, unpredictable workloads. This paper
proposes a novel approach for real-time power management using Reinforcement Learning
(RL). We developed a simulated embedded system environment in Python using the Gymnasium
toolkit, modeling key physical characteristics such as CPU performance states, power
consumption, task queues with deadlines, and thermal dynamics. An RL agent, based on the
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, was trained to dynamically select the optimal
power state by observing the system&#39;s task load and temperature. The agent&#39;s performance was
benchmarked against three traditional policies: static &quot;Performance,&quot; static &quot;Power Save,&quot; and
a &quot;Reactive&quot; heuristic. The results demonstrate the clear superiority of the RL-based approach.
The trained agent completed over 95% of the tasks processed by the &quot;Performance&quot; policy, while
reducing the number of missed deadlines by more than 90% compared to reactive policies.
Crucially, it achieved this by learning an intelligent, proactive control strategy, effectively
managing thermal constraints, and demonstrating a robust, adaptive solution for power-aware
computing in modern embedded systems.
